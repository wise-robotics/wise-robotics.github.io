# Wise Robotics website

## Install dev tools

The only external requirement is Ruby>=2.0 and the `bundler` Gem (can be installed via `gem install bundler`).
To install all other needed tools by running `bundle install --path vendor --binstubs`.

## Running the dev version

Start the dev server by running `./bin/jekyll serve --drafts`.
The site automatically rebuilds on any change.
